### install and run ###

#the save way with node.js#

- install node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- remember to add installation-path to your path variable
- open a terminal and move to your local cloned repository
- run "npm install"
- when it's finished run "npm start"
-> this starts a websever on "localhost" and port 3000. It should also open your default browser
with this adress. If not please start manually. 

- if you are interested in the karma unit-tests and continuous-testing run "npm test"

#deploy on webserver#
- might not work on every webserver without making further settings.


#if you want to run karma unit-tests:
- node.js should be installed
